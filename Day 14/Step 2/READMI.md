# Day 14: Restroom Redoubt - Part Two
## Problem Overview
Discover the exact moment when robots spontaneously arrange themselves to form a Christmas tree pattern.

## Challenge Objective
- Find the *minimum number of seconds* required for robots to create a recognizable Christmas tree formation

## Key Characteristics
- Same robot navigation rules as Part One
- Robots continue moving according to initial velocities
- Seek the precise moment of Christmas tree configuration

## Exploration Strategy
1. Track robot positions over time
2. Identify the first moment they resemble a Christmas tree
3. Determine the elapsed seconds at that moment

## Input
- Same as Part One
- List of robot initial positions and velocities
- Format: `p=x,y v=x,y`

## Output
- Single integer representing seconds elapsed before Christmas tree formation
