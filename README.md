## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event that provides a series of daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. These challenges are designed to test your problem-solving and coding skills.

You can find the puzzles on the official Advent of Code website: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **year** (e.g., `2024`, `2025`), and within each year, by **days** (e.g., `Day 1`, `Day 2`, ...).  
Each day is further divided into **steps** (`Step 1`, `Step 2`), which correspond to the two parts of each daily puzzle.

## Disclaimer: Just for Fun! 😄

While these solutions may seem simple or even a bit quirky, that's because they are! I'm solving these puzzles just for fun and to enjoy the challenge. Don't expect cutting-edge algorithms or overly complex solutions, I'm here to have a good time. 🎉
