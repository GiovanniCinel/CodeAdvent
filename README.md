# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! Here you'll find my solutions to the daily puzzles released during this exciting coding event. ðŸš€

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **days** (e.g., `day 1`, `day 2`, ...) and each day is further divided into **steps** (e.g., `step 1`, `step 2`). Each step corresponds to a part of the daily puzzle.
