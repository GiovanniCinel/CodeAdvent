## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event that provides a series of daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. These challenges are designed to test your problem-solving and coding skills.

You can find the puzzles on the official Advent of Code website: [https://adventofcode.com/2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **days** (e.g., `day 1`, `day 2`, ...) and each day is further divided into **steps** (`step 1`, `step 2`). Each step corresponds to one of the two daily puzzle.

```
## Contents of Each Folder:

- **solution.py**: My code for solving the puzzle (I started by solving with **Python** code, but it is possible that I will use other languages (e.g. **c++**).

## Disclaimer: Just for Fun! 😄

While these solutions may seem simple or even a bit quirky, that's because they are! I'm solving these puzzles just for fun and to enjoy the challenge. Don't expect cutting-edge algorithms or overly complex solutions—I'm here to have a good time. 🎉
