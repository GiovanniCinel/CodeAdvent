# Day 8: Resonant Collinearity - Part Two

## Problem Overview

While working on the calculations for resonant collinearity, one of The Historians pointed out an oversight: resonant harmonics need to be considered! With this update, the conditions for antinodes have changed.

### New Antinode Rules

An antinode now occurs at any grid position that is perfectly in line with **at least two antennas of the same frequency**, regardless of their distance. 

This new rule means that:

- Antinodes can now occur at the position of each antenna (if the antenna is not the only one of its frequency).
- Antinodes previously defined by distance constraints still count.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the following example with three `T`-frequency antennas:

```
T....#....
...T......
.T....#...
.........#
..#.......
..........
...#......
..........
....#.....
..........
```

The three `T`-frequency antennas are all exactly in line with two other antennas, so they also act as antinodes. The total number of antinodes in this example is **9**.

Now let's revisit the original example map with the updated rules:

```
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

Under the updated rules, the total number of unique antinodes is **34**, including the positions of antennas that are in line with others of the same frequency.

### Your Task

Calculate the total impact of the signal using this updated model. Specifically, determine how many unique grid locations within the map boundaries contain an antinode.

## Input

- A grid of characters representing antennas (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and empty spaces (`.`).

## Output

- The total number of unique grid locations containing an antinode within the map boundaries.
