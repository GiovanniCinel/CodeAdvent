# Day 8: Resonant Collinearity

## Problem Overview

While investigating a top-secret Easter Bunny installation, you discover a network of antennas emitting signals that subtly influence consumer behavior. You decide to analyze the signal's impact by mapping and calculating unique antinodes created by these antennas.

### Antenna and Antinode Rules

- Each antenna is tuned to a specific frequency represented by a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or digit.
- Antinodes occur at points perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency:
  - One antenna must be twice as far away as the other from the antinode.
  - Antinodes can appear at the position of antennas.
- Antennas with different frequencies do not create antinodes (e.g., 'A' and 'a' are distinct).

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input Map
```
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

#### Antinodes Created
For this example:
1. Antennas with frequency `a` produce antinodes:
   ```
   ..........
   ...#......
   ..........
   ....a.....
   ..........
   .....a....
   ..........
   ......#...
   ..........
   ..........
   ```
2. Adding another `a`-frequency antenna adds more antinodes:
   ```
   ..........
   ...#......
   #.........
   ....a.....
   ........a.
   .....a....
   ..#.......
   ......#...
   ..........
   ..........
   ```
3. The frequency `A` does not interfere with `a`, but overlaps can occur:
   ```
   ......#....#
   ...#....0...
   ....#0....#.
   ..#....0....
   ....0....#..
   .#....A.....
   ...#........
   #......#....
   ........A...
   .........A..
   ..........#.
   ..........#.
   ```

In this example:
- A total of **14 unique locations** within the map boundaries contain an antinode.

### Task

Given a map of antennas (your puzzle input), calculate how many **unique locations** within the bounds of the map contain an antinode.

---

## Input Format

- A 2D grid of characters (`.` for empty space, other characters for antennas of specific frequencies).
- Grid dimensions may vary but are rectangular.

---

## Output Format

- A single integer indicating the count of unique locations that contain an antinode.
